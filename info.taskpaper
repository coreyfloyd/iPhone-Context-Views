iPhone Context Views:

This is a mirror of the main project at 
	http://codaset.com/coreyfloyd/iphone-context-view

	To use context views in your app, import the following 5 files from the sample project:

		ContextView.h
		ContextView.m
		ContextMenuView.h
		ContextMenuView.m
		ContextViewActions.h
	
	And if you want to add a black stroke around your menus, include:
		UIView+Extensions

The setup and use is pretty simple, so there isn't much documentation. Have fun!
